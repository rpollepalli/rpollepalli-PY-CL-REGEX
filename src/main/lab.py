"""
Regular expressions, often referred to as regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and text 
manipulation. They provide a concise and flexible way to describe and match patterns within strings. 
Regular expressions are widely used in various programming languages and are particularly useful for 
tasks such as data validation, searching, and text processing.

Regular expressions offer a versatile and efficient way to handle textual data. They enable programmers 
to define complex search patterns, making it easier to locate, extract, or manipulate specific information 
within strings. Whether you're validating user input, searching for specific patterns in a document, or 
extracting data from a large dataset, regular expressions can significantly streamline these tasks.
